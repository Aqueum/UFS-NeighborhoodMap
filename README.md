# Purpose & design
This is a singe page web app that helps homeless people find somewhere to sleep in Edinburgh.
It is also an assessed project, hence some of the functionality (& certainly the use of KnockoutJS) was dictated by
this [project specification](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/17/view)

# Getting Started
1. Go to https://aqueum.github.io/UFS-NeighborhoodMap/
2. Hopefully the app will be self explanatory
3. If you don't see a map the chances are there is a google API key issue,
please [contact me](http://www.aqueum.com/contact/)

# Known issues
## Not built
At time of writing, I'm still in planning stages, so none of the following files exist, hence it probably won't work.

# Files
## index.html
The html file that is served as the initial view, which calls app.js which does most of the heavy lifting

## js/app.js
The bulk of the app, initially including:
- the data (in the future this will be moved to a database)
- the ViewModel which controls what you see & how you interact with it
- the

## css/styles.css
the cascading style sheets that make the html a little less ugly.

# Contributing
This is an assessed project, so I'd probably get in trouble for accepting external input.

# Code Status
Can Udacity add a badge here..?

# License
This is an assessed project, but also may be further developed to help a local community interest company,

if you have any questions.
